Calculator HTML
---------------

Work out how many buttons you need
Create a container and then the amount of buttons based on this
Add equals button
Add clear button
Add screen

0-9 = 10
4 operators = 14
equals = 15
clear = 16
so 4x4 grid

Screen = 1 unit high, 4 wide

So calculator is 6 units high, 4 wide

I've missed off the decimal point! So 17 buttons required which means some will have to be a bigger size. We could have 20, eg 4x5 and some being bigger. also negative sign. so 18 buttons
