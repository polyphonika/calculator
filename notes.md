Calculator HTML
---------------

Next steps:
* ~~Floating points ~~
**  ~~ Users can get floating point numbers if they do the math required to get one, but they can’t type them in yet. Add a . button and let users input decimals! Make sure you don’t let them type more than one though: 12.3.56.5. It is hard to do math on these numbers. (disable the decimal button if there’s already one in the display) ~~
* ~~Negative numbers~~
* ~~You should round answers with long decimals so that they don’t overflow the screen.~~
* ~~Pressing = before entering all of the numbers or an operator could cause problems!~~
* ~~Pressing “clear” should wipe out any existing data. Make sure the user is really starting fresh after pressing “clear”~~
* ~~Display a snarky error message if the user tries to divide by 0… and don’t let it crash your calculator!~~
* ~~Backspace button~~
* ~~Keyboard support~~
* ~~Check chatGPT for logic tidying~~
* CSS, overall styling

**Bugs** 
* ~~Cap the display length if more than > 16 (ish) characters~~
* ~~Connect % operator~~
