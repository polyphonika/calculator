Calculator HTML
---------------

Next steps:
* ~~Floating points ~~
**  ~~ Users can get floating point numbers if they do the math required to get one, but they can’t type them in yet. Add a . button and let users input decimals! Make sure you don’t let them type more than one though: 12.3.56.5. It is hard to do math on these numbers. (disable the decimal button if there’s already one in the display) ~~
* Negative numbers
* ~~You should round answers with long decimals so that they don’t overflow the screen.~~
* ~~Pressing = before entering all of the numbers or an operator could cause problems!~~
* Pressing “clear” should wipe out any existing data. Make sure the user is really starting fresh after pressing “clear”
* Display a snarky error message if the user tries to divide by 0… and don’t let it crash your calculator!
* Backspace button
* Keyboard support
* Check chatGPT for logic tidying
* CSS, overall styling

**Bugs**

Scratch area:

1) ~~change int logic to floats~~
2) ~~enable button, ensure works with calc logic and display logic~~
** ~~basic float logic, does it work?~~
** ~~does the display work~~
** ~~leading zeroes~~
** ~~multiple dots~~
** ~~rounding~~
** ~~standard float errors~~
3) ~~disable button if already have one decimal~~
